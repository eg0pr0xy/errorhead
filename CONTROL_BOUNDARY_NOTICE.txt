CONTROL BOUNDARY (LOCKED)

This project enforces a strict separation between UI and Media Core.

UI:
- Must NOT access HTMLVideoElement/HTMLImageElement directly.
- Must NOT call play(), pause(), or set currentTime on media elements.
- STOP/rewind controls are forbidden; do not reset media time or buffers from UI.

Media Core (App.tsx + media_loader/*):
- Sole authority to create and control media elements.
- Produces FrameSource; effects/render consume frames only.

Why this lock exists:
- Prevents parallel media pipelines and hard-to-debug state races.
- Ensures the FrameSource contract remains the single source of truth.

CI Guardrails:
- .github/workflows/media-lock.yml forbids playback control (play/pause/currentTime)
  in services/engine/effects directories. Only App.tsx and media_loader are allowed.

If you need to extend controls:
- Add new callbacks in UI → implement their behavior in App.tsx.
- Do not pass media elements or refs through UI.
